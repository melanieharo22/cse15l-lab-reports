**What is remote access and why is it used?**
- way to connect users to a remote computer 
- great tool for remote access
- allows you to log in and run commands on a remote machine just as if you were sitting in front of it 
## Logging into a remote SSH
## Step 1: CSE15L Account Lookup
1. insert TritonLink username and PID into Account Lookup module [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

11. enter your new password that meets the requirements (different from previous passwords, at least 12 characters long, include upper & lower case, numbers and special symbols, not contain any part of your username) â†’ *from previous experience: I have reset my password about 3 times total for CSE/ECE classes and found that when my password contained @!, my password reset process was more successful in the sense that it took less than 15 minutes for me to put in this newly reset password into the terminal after completing the SSH step)*
