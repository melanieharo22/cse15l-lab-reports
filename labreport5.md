# CSE 15L Lab Report 5 - Debugging & Reflection

**Part 1: Debugging Scenario** <br />

**Part 2: Reflection** <br /> 
I really enjoyed this class because I learned a plethora of skills and techniques that will save me time. I additionally learned a 
lot of useful tools such as Vim, bash, Git, and being exposed to that in this class has helped me explore them even further outside of 
class and even use them during other times. I've found myself writing bash scripts and using Vim and bash in the IEEE-Supercomputing club to run cool benchmarks like the HPL and HPCG benchmarks. The most important thing I have learned was to use "tab" because it saves you time. I learned how to be more efficient, but also creative. <br />
