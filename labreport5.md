# CSE 15L Lab Report 5 - Debugging & Reflection

**Part 1: Debugging Scenario** <br />
A student was struggling with a bash script that asked for user input for a dividend and divisor and performed some division. This is what the 
student posted in their Edstem post asking for help. <br />

These are images the student attached in their post: <br />
This is the bash script itself: <br />

This is the output shown in the student's terminal: <br />

This is what the TA/Tutor posted in response: <br />
"It looks like your while loop is causing you some trouble, it is giving you a logical error. When you set your while loop to always run as long as it is true, it will run an infinite amount of times. Try fixng your while loop to only make it run a certain amount of times--basically execute a certain number of iterations. I suggest using counter variable to keep track of the number of iterations and exits the loop after a specific number of iterations." <br />
<br />
After seeing this feedback, the student went back and fixed their code to include a counter variable in their while loop. <br />
**Part 2: Reflection** <br /> 
I really enjoyed this class because I learned a plethora of skills and techniques that will save me time. I additionally learned a 
lot of useful tools such as Vim, bash, Git, and being exposed to that in this class has helped me explore them even further outside of 
class and even use them during other times. I've found myself writing bash scripts and using Vim and bash in the IEEE-Supercomputing club to run cool benchmarks like the HPL and HPCG benchmarks. The most important thing I have learned was to use "tab" because it saves you time. I learned how to be more efficient, but also creative. <br />
